# FakeOS

A creation of a fake Operating System that emulates the real feeling of using one!

This project utilises different skills learned both through the _nology program, as well as things I have taught myself.

SycamoreOS is a Twin Peaks themed Operating System for mobile devices.

A note that the Calculator function does make use of .eval(), which does have known security issues/vulnerabilities, but for the purpose of this project it should be okay as it is not hosted on a live server.
